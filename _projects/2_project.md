During my undergraduate studies, we developed a game for Android mobile users, in this game, we had prepared about more than 100 of manipulated images, and users had to guess the Persian proverb associated with that manipulated image. Below are some screen shots of our game.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/khar2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/khar3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
