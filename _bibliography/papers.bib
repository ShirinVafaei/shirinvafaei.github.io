      abstract={The development of algorithms to accurately decode of neural information is a long-standing effort in the field of neuroscience. Brain decoding is typically employed by training machine learning models to map neural data onto a preestablished vector representation of stimulus features. These vectors are usually derived from image- and/or text-based feature spaces. Nonetheless, the intrinsic characteristics of these vectors might be fundamentally different than those encoded by the brain, limiting the ability of algorithms to accurately learn this mapping. To address this issue, here, we propose a representation learning framework, called brain-aligning of semantic vectors, that fine-tunes pretrained feature vectors to better align with the structure of neural representations of visual stimuli in the human brain. We trained this model with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data representing 150 visual stimulus categories; then, we performed zero-shot brain decoding on 1) fMRI, 2) magnetoencephalography (MEG), and 3) electrocorticography (ECoG) data reflecting neural representations of visual stimuli. By using fMRI-based brain-aligned vectors, the zero-shot decoding accuracy all three neuroimaging datasets increased. This finding underscores the potential of leveraging a richer array of brainderived features to increase the performance of brain decoding algorithms.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
